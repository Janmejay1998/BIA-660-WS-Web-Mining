# Movie Scraper

Extend the Scraping HTML websites.ipynb notebook so that the csv file it produces has the following five columns (in that order): <br>

* critic name (e.g. Avi Offer) <br>
* review text (e.g. A bold, provocative and razor-sharp satire. One of the most wickedly funny satires since The Player and What Just Happened.) <br>
* review date (e.g. Jun 15, 2022) <br>
* critic's platform (e.g. NYC Movie Guru) <br>
* rating ( this should be the word 'rotten' or the word 'fresh', depending on the icon of the review. 'fresh' for red, 'rotten' for green). <br>
* The deliverable is the updated notebook. <br>

Please use the csv.writer tool to create the file, exactly as we did in class.
