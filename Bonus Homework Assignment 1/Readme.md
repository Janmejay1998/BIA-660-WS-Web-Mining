# Cookie Banner Assignment (Extra Credit)

* Extend the CNN Scraper notebook that we saw in class, so that it automatically clicks on the "Accept All" button at the right side of the Cookie banner that pops up when we first visit cnn. <br>
* The current version relies on the human user to click on the button manually. <br>
* Your task is to avoid that and do everything automatically via selenium & python. <br>
