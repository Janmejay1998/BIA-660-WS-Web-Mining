Write a classification script named 'classifier.py' that trains on reviews_train.txt and achieves the maximum possible accuracy on reviews_test.txt. <br>

Requirement 1: Your script has to use a Voting Classifier with exactly 5 different classification algorithms. <br>

Requirement 2: Your script has to use grid search to optimize at least 2 parameters for each of the 5 algorithms. <br>

You get 10 points for satisfying requirements 1 and 2. <br>
