Keith Garlington,"Aug 24, 2022",Christopher Nolan has once again done what he does best – create an exhilarating cinematic experience aimed at wowing you visually and challenging you intellectually.,fresh
Jeffrey Harris,"Aug 22, 2022",A game cast and topnotch production values are unable to improve upon a clunky script and awkward execution. Tenet fails to reach its lofty ambitions. It also suffers from one of the worst sound mixes in a modern film at this level.,rotten
Cris Kennedy,"Aug 17, 2022",The production team create some fantastically enjoyable big moments of cerebral high-octane fun that made the film's two-and-a-half hour run-time fly by.,fresh
Daniel Howat,"May 20, 2022","Tenet is an intense blockbuster that doesn’t let up, and we’re swept along with the momentum of it all. Don’t try to understand it, just feel it.",fresh
James Luxford,"Feb 26, 2022","A story people will try to explain to others, probably badly, who will in turn head to the multiplex to form their own opinion. If the mission was to create a discussion, then Tenet is a huge success.",fresh
Brian Eggert,"Feb 17, 2022","Tenet suffers most from its absence of feeling and thinly described characters, leaving Nolan's cinematic puzzle box a contraption with nothing inside for those who attempt to solve it.",rotten
Alonso Díaz de la Vega,"Dec 9, 2021","Nolan finally seems to admit that he is not interested in people or their stories or their emotions, but rather using their forms, their bodies, to fill them with abstractions. [Full review in Spanish]",rotten
William Venegas,"Dec 8, 2021",The film begins to entangle itself. [Full review in Spanish],rotten
Witney Seibold,"Sep 13, 2021","For all its ambition, 'Tenet' is a mushy glob of nonsense.",rotten
Cory Woodroof,"Sep 8, 2021","Tenet is one of Nolan's most cerebral films, as confounding as it is scintillating.",fresh
Nicholas Oon,"Sep 5, 2021","It's interesting to consider that Nolan and the entire team believed in creating a challenging narrative with the escapism, wonder, and thrill of the best cinematic experience.",fresh
Lonita Cook,"Aug 31, 2021","Heaps of plot devices, Washington's ridiculously cool fight scenes and Pattinson looking in a suit like a hunk that just won't quit only mildly distracts from the over-complicated and nonsensical world of Tenet.",rotten
Taylor Baker,"Aug 19, 2021","Nolan revisits all the pieces of formulaic ingenuity that have risen him to the pinnacle of non-franchise blockbuster cinema, and it's fun.",fresh
Maria Lattila,"Aug 10, 2021","This is a narrative purely driven by the action and concept, but it lacks a human connection. There is nothing to grasp, nothing to identify with on-screen, no matter how charismatic the actors are.",rotten
Alex Behan,"Jul 26, 2021",[A] stylish espionage thriller.,fresh
Robin Holabird,"Jul 19, 2021","Never slowing down to explain much or allow a passive moment, Tenet almost requires a second or third viewing, all part of the Nolan pattern that creates moneymaking blockbusters.",fresh
Isaac Feldberg,"Jun 10, 2021","Nolan prioritizes the dense audiovisual spectacle of his most narratively complex films. Beyond the intellectual, they exist primarily, and more accessibly, as experiences. Put another way: Tenet is a vibe.",fresh
Lawrence Garcia,"Jun 5, 2021","Tenet fails to convince as either dramatic or action spectacle, let alone as philosophical investigation ... [it's] a house of cards, built only to be toppled over.",rotten
Andrew Kendall,"May 10, 2021","Even as Tenet engages in loads of hand-wringing about the implications the characters' actions have for the future, it's hard to really form any worry for that future that exists only in prolepsis.",rotten
Nick Levine,"May 5, 2021","Though it's sometimes hamstrung by clumsy dialogue - a necessary evil, perhaps, given how much Nolan needs to explain - Tenet is rarely less than thrilling to watch.",fresh
Rhys Bowen Jones,"Apr 17, 2021",Tenet is one of the most enthralling cinematic experiences I have had for years.,fresh
Jeffrey Overstreet,"Apr 4, 2021","Exhausted and disoriented by Nolan's curlicue-rollercoasters, we end up fooled into thinking we've been stirred when, in fact, we've mostly been shaken.",rotten
Niall Browne,"Apr 2, 2021","Christopher Nolan's Tenet is a film which can be enjoyed, but it's highly likely that you won't really understand it. It takes a lot of big ideas - and a lot of big moviemaking techniques to deliver a film which is mesmerising but very flawed.",fresh
David Walsh,"Mar 24, 2021","It is not so much a matter of criticizing Nolan's filmmaking, which is not very difficult to do. The important issue is to understand and criticize the conditions that produced his filmmaking ...",rotten
Vincent Schilling,"Mar 19, 2021","Led beautifully by protagonist John David Washington, 'Tenet', an exceptional action-packed film, dives into a concept of twisting time in a way never explored before. I'm adding this to my permanent library.",fresh
Tim Robey,"Mar 13, 2021","As a delivery system for the thrills, I think the film gets a long way, and you can kind of sit back and enjoy it. As a delivery system for the ideas, I think it trips itself up an awful lot.",rotten
Pablo O. Scholz,"Mar 4, 2021",[Has] perfectly orchestrated battle scenes. [Full review in Spanish],fresh
Rob Gonsalves,"Feb 25, 2021","It means what you want it to mean, and I don't want it to mean anything. It's just a ride.",fresh
Mark Meszoros,"Feb 21, 2021","By the end of its two-and-a-half-hours, with all its bi-directional action, revelations and world-ending ramifications, it's a bit numbing, And you're pretty sure you can't wait to watch it again.",fresh
Eddie Harrison,"Feb 17, 2021","...a high-faluting, high energy, uber-glam espionage thriller...",fresh
Tony Black,"Feb 14, 2021","Just go with it. Allow the inversion to pull you along because it does, for the most part, make sense by the end.",fresh
Alix Turner,"Feb 13, 2021","Huge scale, gripping and ambitious sci-fi spy thriller from Christopher Nolan, which simply has to be seen to be believed, and possibly seen more than once to be fully appreciated.",fresh
Brian Gill,"Feb 10, 2021",It's the most Nolan movie ever and I'm not sure it makes since but I was enthralled nonetheless.,fresh
Kathia Woods,"Feb 10, 2021",The future is now or in the past,fresh
Alex Bentley,"Feb 5, 2021",Nolan's obsession with making his films as complex as humanly possible is frustrating for those of us who would like at least a scintilla of clarity in our storytelling.,rotten
MaryAnn Johanson,"Feb 5, 2021","Washington and Pattinson have palpable charisma, but this cold puzzle offers no incentive to solve it. Throw in damsel-in-distress crap, and both my geek sensibilities and my feminism are offended.",rotten
Nick Schager,"Feb 3, 2021","Something like the epitome of [Nolan's] temporally twisty canon, distilling his many cinematic signatures and preoccupations down to their entrancing abstract essence.",fresh
PJ Nabarro,"Jan 31, 2021",Nolan's reverence for tech and the cleverness of pulling off a metaphysical narrative puzzle finally swamps his awareness of whether the thing in question is even any good.,rotten
Richard Crouse,"Jan 29, 2021",The trippy last hour is jam packed with artfully arranged action scenes that manipulate time in increasingly psychedelic ways.,fresh
Mark Cassidy,"Jan 28, 2021","Tenet has its moments, but is easily Nolan's worst film. Mostly incomprehensible; this muddled sci-fi thriller is a long way from being the ""savior of cinema."" Honestly, it'd be difficult to recommend even if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic.",rotten
Sean Fennessey,"Jan 27, 2021","Tenet asks for patience as it winds forward and backward through its narrative accordion structure...savor, even [its] flaws.",fresh
Joey Morona,"Jan 27, 2021",...'Tenet' makes 'Inception' feel like a children's story. The film is magnificently and perhaps quite purposefully confusing.,fresh
Luke Hicks,"Jan 26, 2021","Tenet isn't here to collect Oscars. It exists to pummel you with excitement, twist your sense of reality, and leave you confounded with the deafening power of its nine-figure budget.",fresh
Matt Brunson,"Jan 21, 2021","The weakest of Nolan's 11 cinematic at-bats to date, Tenet finds the filmmaker unable to get out of his own way as he attempts to spin a yarn that makes earlier efforts like Memento seem as linear and uncomplicated as A Charlie Brown Christmas.",rotten
Ben Kuchera,"Jan 19, 2021","I love Tenet so much, despite its frustrations. Nolan wants to keep pushing the boundaries of these kinds of blockbusters, and that means he's going to fail as much as he succeeds.",fresh
Sheraz Farooqi,"Jan 13, 2021","Tenet is a Christopher Nolan film in every way. An amalgamation of themes & threads out of his other films combined into one, Tenet has shades of Nolan's best work, but not without flaws.",fresh
Yasser Medina,"Jan 4, 2021","A science fiction film in which Nolan builds, visually, a twisted and frenetic experience of international espionage that is structured as if it were a narrative palindrome of dualities and retrocausality. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
Diana Mangas,"Jan 3, 2021","It's an audiovisual experience that no movie lover should miss. Stimulating, revealing, adrenaline-pumping and spectacular, this is Christopher Nolan's new proposal. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
Susan Granger,"Jan 2, 2021",Visually dazzling but absolutely incomprehensible and impenetrable...,rotten
Nestor Bentancor,"Dec 29, 2020",Less of a puzzle and more like a mechanical bull. But at home you can tame -and appreciate- this beast. [Full Review in Spanish],fresh
Armond White,"Dec 29, 2020","Fact is, Tenet should not be taken more seriously than a James Bond movie. As an action film, it isn't nearly as skillful as a Tom Cruise Mission Impossible commodity.",rotten
Grant Watson,"Dec 29, 2020","It is an imperfect film, but to dismiss it would be to punish it for merely being 'good' and not 'great'.",fresh
Victor Pineyro,"Dec 28, 2020","The film feels a lot like an allusion of its palindrome title. What I like most about Nolan, and Tenet, is that it challenges me and reminds me, forgive the redundancy, that movies are first felt and then understood. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
Robert Roten,"Dec 27, 2020","Even if you are confused by all this complexity, there is still much to enjoy here. For me, it was just too much. I prefer more character depth and less emphasis on manufactured plot complications.",fresh
Christopher Llewellyn Reed,"Dec 26, 2020",Love your palindromes? The film is a dud.,rotten
Sarah Marrs,"Dec 26, 2020",Anyone who insists Tenet is Important or Otherwise Notable is probably trying to sell you something.,rotten
Kent Garrison,"Dec 26, 2020","Like with other Christopher Nolan films, it will take multiple viewings to fully realize the scope of Tenet's groundbreaking accomplishments.",fresh
Daniel M. Kimmel,"Dec 24, 2020","If you stick it out to the end, you'll either hate it or feel you need to watch it again.",fresh
Jim Ross,"Dec 23, 2020","TENET ends up something of a Rube Goldberg machine of a film: a wondrously complex set of mechanics that is fascinating, but also an incredibly convoluted way of masking what is, in essence, a thin and poorly executed story.",rotten
Fico Cangiano,"Dec 23, 2020","Christopher Nolan's most ambitious and complex film to date, also ends up being his most cold and lacking emotion. Not all of it works, but it's still better than many of the other releases this year. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
Joel Mayward,"Dec 23, 2020","""Tenet"" succeeds in somehow transcending the audience's basic understanding of time and narrative while nevertheless keeping them engaged and entertained for the film's entirety.",fresh
John Serba,"Dec 22, 2020","A Christopher Nolan movie is an event, and Tenet and its extraordinary action set pieces justify such a tag.",fresh
Frank Swietek,"Dec 22, 2020","A flashy disappointment-intricate but not especially involving, clever but never captivating...a sterile exercise in spy movie cliché, with a twist that allows for some striking effects but... proves far less engaging than Nolan thinks it is.",rotten
Juan Barquin,"Dec 22, 2020","Amid all the nonsensical writing, messy action, and blank characters, Tenet is a display of the pure, unfiltered blockbuster-filmmaking sensibilities that Nolan always delivers.",fresh
Tim Cogshell,"Dec 22, 2020","[Christopher Nolan] is very clever, but mostly irritating is what I find. [His movies] are not cerebral - they're fake cerebral... He doesn't even do the time travel right.",rotten
Christy Lemire,"Dec 22, 2020","I am a big fan of [Christopher Nolan's] films -- I usually enjoy the time puzzle of it -- but this seems even more intentionally inaccessible and challenging than everything else... Confusing, distancing, and chilly.",rotten
Daniel Barnes,"Dec 21, 2020",Nolan at his most thrilling and semi-comprehensible.,fresh
Jared Mobarak,"Dec 19, 2020","[We] get the full Nolan treatment in spectacle without [any] emotional and psychological lifting. It'll never [match] his best, but it's undeniably entertaining nonetheless.",fresh
Ryan Syrek,"Dec 18, 2020","From Tenet's opening sequence to the final climactic battle, not knowing exactly what the hell is going on has never been so fun! That's actually kinda sincere...",fresh
Achara Kirk,"Dec 18, 2020","I could see the points when the movie was like: this is the moment where I want you to have that emotional feeling, and I really wanted to get there... there wasn't enough done in the build-up of this whole movie for me to actually, really care.",rotten
Jaby Koay,"Dec 18, 2020",It didn't engage with me as a viewer... the biggest reason I can see is that the main character didn't have this goal that was recognizable.,rotten
Jeffrey M. Anderson,"Dec 18, 2020","'Tenet' may contain [Nolan's] most ambitious use of time, but also, ultimately, the least effective.",rotten
Sean Burns,"Dec 17, 2020","Garbled nonsense of a most entertaining order, it's basically a Christopher Nolan fetish film.",fresh
G. Allen Johnson,"Dec 17, 2020","""Tenet"" is indeed impressive, although I gave up trying to follow the plot.",fresh
Mick LaSalle,"Dec 17, 2020","""Tenet"" is difficult to understand, but even worse, it inspires little desire to understand it.",rotten
Devesh Sharma,"Dec 17, 2020","All-in-all, much like the film's subject, Tenet is a film way ahead of its time. It's Nolan's most audacious experiment. Whether posterity favours it kindly -- only time will tell...",fresh
Chris Agar,"Dec 15, 2020",Tenet﻿ is a fascinating and exciting sci-fi thriller bolstered by Nolan's grand vision for action and strong performances from the cast.,fresh
Allison Rose,"Dec 15, 2020",Washington is decent as the Protagonist but not as good as he was as Ron Stallworth in BlacKkKlansman.,fresh
Mario Alegre,"Dec 14, 2020","""Tenet"" squanders all its visual spectacle through obtuse storytelling and dramatic inertia. [Full Review in Spanish]",rotten
Edwin Arnaudin,"Dec 14, 2020",The convoluted logic begins to detract from the film's enjoyment - or it would if Nolan didn't keep tossing out exciting visuals to keep viewers engaged and challenged.,fresh
Mike McGranaghan,"Dec 14, 2020",Tenet is Christopher Nolan's weakest film. It's also evidence that Christopher Nolan's weakest film is still way better and more exciting than some directors' best films.,fresh
Tessa Smith,"Dec 14, 2020","The story & plot are super intriguing and quite clever. Once you hit the end of the film, it's all tied up in a neat little bow, proving itself to be more than worth a watch.",fresh
Filipe Freitas,"Dec 13, 2020",... mediocre espionage sci-fi thriller.,rotten
Douglas Davidson,"Dec 13, 2020","... Tenet is not the best film Nolan's created, but it may be his most ambitious and there's much to be lauded in that.",fresh
Joey Magidson,"Dec 12, 2020",Tenet will go down as middle of the road Christopher Nolan. It's not a masterpiece and it's not a misfire.,fresh
Fred Topel,"Dec 10, 2020",It's basically Inception for time travel instead of dreams.,fresh
Danielle Solzman,"Dec 10, 2020",The best way to go about trying to understand Tenet is to just sit there and enjoy the ride.,fresh
Prahlad Srihari,"Dec 5, 2020","If Tenet were a Beatles song, it would be Revolution 9: gun shots and car crashes, breaking glass and muffled words, all come together in a mix, made all the more unintelligible by segments happening forward and backward.",rotten
Rohan Naahar,"Dec 4, 2020",To be constantly told how Tenet's engine works is like having Peter Jackson explain the metallurgy behind the One Ring -- unnecessary.,rotten
Emmanuel Báez,"Nov 30, 2020","A well-oiled machine in which each element fulfills a specific function, and like all machinery, lacks a soul... Nonetheless, Tenet is a fascinating experience. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
Charles Koplinski,"Nov 27, 2020",Christopher Nolan's latest mindbender contains his trademark elaborate set pieces but lacks a story that makes a lick of sense.,rotten
Jim Schembri,"Nov 20, 2020",A beautiful mess.,fresh
Ross Anthony,"Nov 12, 2020","Excellent hard-hitting big-budget action, inconsistent dialogue /acting, refreshingly clever brain-stretching plot, great sound, a tad longer than necessary. Prepare to be confused, but entertained!",fresh
Tony Baker,"Oct 31, 2020","I was confused... but it was well executed, well acted. It looked fantastic. The set pieces, the originality of the story was great.",fresh
Marie Asner,"Oct 31, 2020","A film that wends its way around time, backward and forward, needs some space, and filling it with more intricacy doesn't always work.",rotten
Israel Acosta Aroche,"Oct 30, 2020",For the first time in a long time Christopher Nolan's work just gets a bit tiring and tiresome as he exploits his obsession with time yet again in a way that's more noisy than expressive. [Full Review in Spanish],rotten
Hugo Hernández Valdivia,"Oct 22, 2020","An interesting palindrome, but really doesn't amount to anything significant. [Full Review in Spanish]",fresh
Robert Slack,"Oct 19, 2020",Tenet is a heck of an achievement and is spectacular to watch. Technologically there is nothing like it.,fresh
Nathan Mattise,"Oct 19, 2020","Tenet is the kind of movie that leaves you asking, ""Why can't we have John David Washington as James Bond?""",fresh
Julio Fernando Navas,"Oct 19, 2020",A cerebral thriller that gives us the most gimmicky version of Nolan we've seen yet. [Full review in spanish],fresh

Mattie Lucas,"Oct 10, 2020","An often electrifying grand scale thriller that tackles bold structural concepts, but its execution is a decidedly mixed bag.",fresh
Tom Santilli,"Oct 8, 2020","When put in context of what we have come to expect from Christopher Nolan...Tenet seems to land with an even more despondent, painful thud.",rotten

Kevin A. Ranson,"Oct 3, 2020",... asks viewers to trust what's going on will make sense once it reveals its secret... one of those rare instances where seeing the film more than once actually reaps a reward...,fresh

Eli Glasner,"Sep 29, 2020","Some films grow richer with each viewing, I fear this one will fade. Best thing I can do is quote one of the time inversion scientists...""don't try to understand it.""",fresh
Kelley Dong,"Sep 28, 2020","The scale of its spectacle suggests innovation; but Nolan's combination of the reverse motion with the cross cut, which he's dressed with trivial exposition, has all been done before.",rotten

Bob Grimm,"Sep 27, 2020",Typically good Nolan puzzler.,fresh

Shawn Edwards,"Sep 22, 2020",John David Washington is the best part of Tenet...stuck in a story that makes zero sense and requires a massive amounts of Advil...,rotten
Dan Tabor,"Sep 22, 2020","Dense and pretentious, Tenet will irritate even the most dedicated Nolan fans with its curiously flawed similarities to Inception.",rotten
Chris McCoy,"Sep 22, 2020","Tenet addresses some important themes, such as the dangers of technology concentrating world-shattering powers in the hands of unaccountable individuals, but it treats the world as an abstraction of physics, not as a real place where real people live.",rotten
Rene Sanchez,"Sep 20, 2020","Ambitious and grandiloquent, Tenet is a palindromic thriller where past and present converge in a mission against the clock. [Full Review in Spanish]",fresh

John McDonald,"Sep 18, 2020",I doubt that even the director could explain what it's about.,rotten

Rendy Jones,"Sep 15, 2020",There comes a point where Nolan's attention to detail as a visionary filmmaker fails to compensate for his current lack of storytelling abilities.,rotten
Kiko Martinez,"Sep 15, 2020","As stellar as Tenet is for the senses, it is not something most moviegoers will want to revisit - unless, of course, they believe Nolan's brand of storytelling really doesn't add up until the third or fourth viewing.",rotten
Jackie K. Cooper,"Sep 15, 2020","The dialogue was a little lame. Kenneth Branagh chewed the scenery. Elizabeth Debicki made no impact. But lordy, lordy no one can put a movie together like Christopher Nolan.",fresh
Rubén Rosario,"Sep 14, 2020","With such lofty goals, the characters are reduced to pieces on a sleek chess board. And if Nolan doesn't give a damn about what happens to his chronology-challenged travelers, why should we?",rotten

Ruth Maramis,"Sep 14, 2020","While I think Nolan is a talented & visionary filmmaker, with TENET he seems to care more about the fantastical spectacle + time inversion extravaganza than he is about an affecting story, so the result frankly, is a cold, detached film.",fresh
Karen M. Peterson,"Sep 13, 2020","It would be easy to dismiss the plot as confusing, but that would be generous.",rotten
Nicolás Ruiz,"Sep 13, 2020","Tenet is an obnoxious, cold and unpleasant movie. Nevertheless, Nolan achieved a rare formal experiment never seen before in summer blockbusters. Hollow, cynic and revolutionary at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
Tom Meek,"Sep 11, 2020","This being a Christopher Nolan film, seeing it on a big screen is kind of a must - in the very least for the imposing, driving score [by Ludwig Göransson] and the impressive camera work by Hoyte Van Hoytema.",fresh
Brett McCracken,"Sep 11, 2020","The real ""inversion"" of Tenet-and ultimately, all of Nolan's films-is that its stretching upward toward the heavens boomerangs back to this world.",fresh
Louisa Moore,"Sep 11, 2020",A solid 3.5 star movie rating was unfolding. Then the big shootout battle reared its ugly head and the film became an overindulgent mash-up of Inception and 1917 that led to a dramatic drop-off in quality - and my interest.,rotten
EJ Moreno,"Sep 11, 2020","This movie tries its hardest to be a complex, puzzling adventure, but it's a puzzle with only 150 pieces. Expected so much more from this, but at least Nolan still gets ""spectacle.""",rotten

Patrick McDonald,"Sep 10, 2020","A glorious mess of a film. The concepts in the film cause whiplash, but the visual cacophony of Christopher Nolan's imagination and current cinema tech is beautiful & emotion.",fresh
Matt Conway,"Sep 10, 2020","Tenet is more of a base single for Christopher Nolan, although even his weakest efforts still provide an exhilarating jolt of blockbuster craftmanship.",fresh

Linda Cook,"Sep 9, 2020",Mind. Officially. Blown.,fresh
Tim Brayton,"Sep 9, 2020","Basically, it's a James Bond film with a bachelor's degree in physics, and it has the decency to be an extremely good James Bond film, on top of it.",fresh
Brandon Avery,"Sep 8, 2020","The concept of ""time inversion"" that Nolan developed is mind blowing being like nothing we've seen before on the big screen, but he fails at simply mixing sound dialogue correctly.",fresh
Joe Friar,"Sep 7, 2020",The most complex work yet by Nolan with a superb John David Washington as the film's protagonist. Visually stunning as the director layers scenes where others would use flashbacks or non-linear edits.,fresh
Neal Pollack,"Sep 7, 2020","As a Christopher Nolan film, it has all the warmth of a meat locker and features a Ludwig Göransson soundtrack that makes you feel like you're inside a shipping container. This is appropriate, since half the movie takes place inside shipping containers.",rotten
Bill Arceneaux,"Sep 7, 2020","'Tenet' is pure escapism, in the tradition of greats like 'King Kong' and 'Bowfinger' (that's right, a comedy).",fresh
Matt Goldberg,"Sep 7, 2020","Nolan's new movie is all gimmick, and devoid of those fascinating questions of identity and truth that invigorated his previous efforts.",rotten
Kaitlyn Booth,"Sep 6, 2020","Tenet is trying very hard to be deep and meaningful, but the archetypical characters and over-explanation of the convoluted storyline means we have a lot of homoeroticism in fantastic menswear in between awesome set pieces.",fresh

Piers Marchant,"Sep 4, 2020","The truth is, I had more fun after putting my pen down and letting it wash over me like an extremely loud, chaotic waterfall.",fresh
Adam Kempenaar,"Sep 4, 2020",Tenet is what happens when Nolan forgets Borden's wisdom [from The Prestige]. He's so obsessed with how impressive his 'secret' is that the trick he uses it for is nothing.,rotten

Anthony O'Connor,"Aug 22, 2020","Overlong, noisy, full of poe-faced delivery of portentous dialogue, needlessly convoluted plot threads, unearned sense of gravitas that verges on the unintentionally hilarious and a script that isn't even vaguely as clever as it seems to think it is",rotten
Wenlei Ma,"Aug 22, 2020","If Tenet had paid as much attention to its writing and character work as it did to its visual and conceptual ambitions, it could have been a masterpiece instead of merely great. But it's still great.",fresh
Philip De Semlyen,"Aug 21, 2020","After five months stuck in front of the small screen, maybe being a little overwhelmed is no bad thing. But it's hard to escape the sense that less might have been more.",rotten
Peter Gray,"Aug 21, 2020","It's breathtaking at times, and frustrating at others, but even with all its near-detrimental ambition it's a film that is at least trying to break a familiar mould.",fresh
Jamie East,"Aug 21, 2020","It's a tense, bewildering assault on the senses. It was never going to live up to all the expectations - but despite the frayed plot and bad script, this is still a film you need to see.",fresh
Alan Corr,"Aug 21, 2020",It's a high concept thriller which never fails to take itself with deadly seriousness but Tenet fails to live up to the intriguing set-up in the first act and doesn't quite convince the viewer of its internal logic...,rotten
Sandra Hall,"Aug 21, 2020","No doubt avid students of the Nolan formula will get months of entertainment out of repeated viewings, but for me it was oddly tantalizing -- full of good things but ultimately frustrating.",fresh
Emily Zemler,"Aug 21, 2020","Nolan is the sort of filmmaker who captures our imaginations for what could be possible, which is something that feels important right now.",fresh
Tom Beasley,"Aug 21, 2020","If a headache can ever be pleasurable, it's when watching Tenet.",fresh
Danny Leigh,"Aug 21, 2020","Great movies always time travel - living with you beyond the closing credits, carried into the future. With Tenet, 150 minutes pass harmlessly, but the film left my head before I took off my face mask.",fresh
Adam Woodward,"Aug 21, 2020","If Nolan has out-Nolaned himself, it's in the action set-pieces which, despite being of head-scrambling technical intricacy, are sharper than Occam's razor and carried off with astonishing economy.",fresh
Scott Davis,"Aug 21, 2020",Nolan is an artist extraordinaire.,fresh
Rosie Fletcher,"Aug 21, 2020","The most important film of the year is a heavy weight to carry, and Tenet for the most part pulls it off. This may not be a perfect film but it could just be perfect cinema.",fresh
Leslie Felperin,"Aug 21, 2020","Altogether, it makes for a chilly, cerebral film - easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity.",rotten
Charlotte O'Sullivan,"Aug 21, 2020","To point out that Tenet has flaws feels ungrateful. It's like slagging off Santa. But, I confess, some of the yick yacking - vis a vis physics, metaphysics and so on - made me sleepy... Those quibbles aside, Tenet is an eye-popping, ground-breaking blast.",fresh
Barry Hertz,"Aug 21, 2020","We're never meant to know what exactly is going on at any one moment, but we will be - we must be - entertained by the overwhelming nonsense of it all.",fresh
Kevin Maher,"Aug 21, 2020","The real joy of the film, nonetheless, is the sheer spectacle.",fresh
Radheyan Simonpillai,"Aug 21, 2020",The movie is a race against a clock that defies everything we know about time. Massively scaled sequences have time moving forward and backwards and zigzagging all at once. The action exceeds anything Nolan has ever done before.,fresh
Linda Marric,"Aug 21, 2020","Revisiting ideas he had already broached in his brilliantly underrated space saga Interstellar, Nolan is back again to his favourite subject, Time. The results are, unsurprisingly, phenomenal.",fresh
Jessica Kiang,"Aug 21, 2020","Seek it out, if only to marvel at the entertainingly inane glory of what we once had and are in danger of never having again.",fresh
Matt Purslow,"Aug 21, 2020","Tenet feels a little conservative, as if Nolan's style is a franchise rather than a framework. Despite this, it remains more interesting than most other tentpole movies and acts as a beacon for the director's strengths.",fresh
Fionnuala Halligan,"Aug 21, 2020","It's a dream ride... for the most part, for anyone looking for glitzy escapism, and who wouldn't include themselves in that demographic right now.",fresh
Jonathan Romney,"Aug 21, 2020","Nolan's latest may well be full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, or it may signify something imponderably resonant, and signify it forward, backward and inside out. Does your head hurt yet?",fresh
Shannon Connellan,"Aug 21, 2020","It's the kind of film worthy of heralding a triumphant, unashamedly explosive return to cinemas, whenever that happens.",fresh
Andy Lea,"Aug 21, 2020","Bamboozling, bold, wildly spectacular - this could be the perfect curtain-raiser for this year's delayed blockbuster season.",fresh
Catherine Shoard,"Aug 21, 2020",The world is more than ready for a fabulous blockbuster... It's a real shame Tenet isn't it.,rotten
Mike McCahill,"Aug 21, 2020","What's really there to untangle, beyond loops of string and a whole lot of smoke rings?",rotten
Brian Lloyd,"Aug 21, 2020","When you come right down to it, 'Tenet' is a mess. A gloriously shot, exquisitely staged mess with a thrilling final act - but still a mess.",rotten
Simon Miraudo,"Aug 21, 2020","For those who don't want to engage with Nolan's academic exercises, just tune out and revel in its baser pleasures: thrilling spy set pieces and charismatic leads. The other stuff? Ain't nobody got time for that.",fresh
Nicholas Barber,"Aug 21, 2020","In the end, ""Tenet"" isn't one of Nolan's most satisfying films. But after I've seen it four or five more times, maybe I'll change my mind.",fresh
James Mottram,"Aug 21, 2020","Happily, Tenet exceeds our already sky-high expectations.",fresh
Clarisse Loughrey,"Aug 21, 2020",Tenet is a thrilling place to get lost in.,fresh
Jordan Farley,"Aug 21, 2020","The stakes have never been higher, but Tenet is exactly the film cinemas need right now.",fresh
Donald Clarke,"Aug 21, 2020","Even if we were brave enough to try, we would not be capable of spoiling a plot so wilfully obtuse it demands repeat viewings to disentangle.",fresh
Laura Potier,"Aug 21, 2020","Tenet is technically excellent and challenging, pushing boundaries and subverting expectations with the director's usual elegance.",fresh
Guy Lodge,"Aug 21, 2020","A concrete cornucopia of global chaos and threat, in which humanity's survival depends on the minor matter of reshaping time and space, ""Tenet"" looks well suited to an anxious age.",fresh
Alex Godfrey,"Aug 21, 2020","By the time it's done, you might not know what the hell's gone on, but it is exciting nevertheless. It is ferociously entertaining.",fresh
Casey Chong,"Aug 21, 2020","For all the technical achievements and Christopher Nolan's potentially captivating time-inversion concept, ""Tenet"" lacks the heart and soul to qualify as among the best movies in his illustrious filmography.",rotten
Ian Sandwell,"Aug 21, 2020","An original and mind-bending take on a spy movie... Solely in terms of technical aspects, it's an incredible feat of filmmaking.",fresh
Jason Gorber,"Aug 21, 2020","Say what you will about the tenets of TENET, at least it has an ethos.",fresh
