# Classification

Create a notebook with a classifier that trains on reviews_train.txt and achieves the maximum possible accuracy on reviews_test.txt. <br>
You can use any type of classifier that you want. <br>
You get 1 point for every extra 1 % over 85%. For example, if you get an accuracy of 90%, you will get 5 points. <br>
100%  is not really possible, just do the best that you can.
